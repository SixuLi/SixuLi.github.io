I am a fifth-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison). 
I am very fortunate to work under the supervision of Prof. [Nicolás García Trillos](https://www.nicolasgarciat.com/) and Prof. [Qin Li](https://sites.google.com/view/qinlimadison/home?authuser=0). 
Prior to UW-Madison, I got my BS in Mathematics and Statistics in Nanjing Univeristy (NJU) in Nanjing China. 

My current research lies in the intersection of applies mathematics and machine learning, with a particular focus on
Interacting Particle Systems, Non-convex Optimization, Multi-Agent-Based Learning, and Generative Modeling.

My full CV can be found [here](https://SixuLi.github.io/files/Sixu_Li_CV.pdf).

**I am seeking postdoctoral positions beginning Summer/Fall of 2026.**
